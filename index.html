        <h3>Speed</h3>
        <p> when you travel at speeds approaching the speed of
            light, time slows down for you relative to the outside world.It’s been measured Using twin atomic clocks (one
            flown in a jet aircraft, the other stationary on Earth) physicists have shown that a flying clock ticks
            slower, because of its speed.

            The next method is also inspired by Einstein. According to his theory of general relativity, the stronger
            the gravity you feel, the slower time moves.

            As you get closer to the centre of the Earth, for example, the strength of gravity increases. Time runs
            slower for your feet than your head.

            Another way to travel to the future may be to slow your perception of time by slowing down, or stopping,
            your bodily processes and then restarting them later.

            Bacterial spores and Some mammals can slow down their metabolism during hibernation, dramatically reducing their cells’
            requirement.
